=====================================

This repository contains many programs and projects I have created in C++. They demonstrate some of my skills and what I am capable of doing. I hope you enjoy using my programs, and please contact me if any of them interest you.

Book Store App is the most complicated of all the assignments I have created. It uses STL maps, dynamic memory allocation, operator overloading, polymorphism, generic programming, template classes, and a lot of inheritance. 

I encourage you to just look through some of the code I have written, to get a general understanding of my skill level and what I am capable of.

Thanks,

Siddhanth Sabharwal
